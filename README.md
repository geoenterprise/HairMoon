# HairMoon
# Overview

As a software developer passionate about turning cultural ideas into digital tools, I built HairMoon to explore how the Kotlin programming language can be used to create logic-driven, user-centered applications. This project gave me hands-on experience with Kotlin syntax and data structures while building something meaningful and fun.

HairMoon is a lunar-based haircut advisor written in Kotlin. It determines whether today (or any date) is a good time to cut hair based on the moon phase — with a special focus on the waxing moon phase, which is culturally believed to be ideal for women’s haircuts. It also provides nearby salon suggestions and predicts the next waxing moon.

My goal with this software was to deepen my knowledge of Kotlin’s syntax and features, including loops, functions, conditionals, classes, and collections. This project helped me solidify how to write clear, idiomatic Kotlin code that interacts with users and handles input.

# Future Work

- Improve the moon phase calculation by connecting to a real lunar phase API
- Enhance the salon list by allowing user input to add and save favorite salons
- Add localization support for multiple languages (e.g., English and Spanish)
- Provide haircut suggestions based on moon phase and hair type
- Expand the project in another module by integrating it with a cloud database or web app
